Absolutely, I'll describe the ideal onboarding and post-login flow in clear, actionable terms without code snippets. Here's how it should work in your Replit-based HVAC software:

### Post-Login Flow Description

1. **Immediate Profile Check After Login**:
- When a user completes Google login, your app should first check if they have an existing company profile in your database
- Show a simple loading spinner during this check (2-3 seconds max)
- If no profile exists: Redirect to onboarding flow
- If profile exists: Redirect to main dashboard

2. **Onboarding Experience**:
- Display a clean, minimal form with:
  * Company name input field (required)
  * User's full name input field (required)
  * "I'm a solo technician" checkbox (default checked)
  * "Finish Setup" button
- When submitted:
  * Create a new company record in your database
  * Create a user profile linked to that company
  * Set role to "admin" (with all permissions)
  * Store the solo status preference
  * Redirect to dashboard

3. **First Dashboard Experience**:
- For solo technicians:
  * Show "My Schedule" as the default view
  * Hide all team management UI elements
  * Auto-assign all new jobs to the logged-in user
  * Simplify navigation: Only show relevant tabs (Schedule, Jobs, Customers, Invoicing)
- For companies with multiple users (if unchecked during onboarding):
  * Show "Dispatch Board" view
  * Include team management options
  * Show technician assignment controls

4. **Database Structure**:
- Companies table: Store company name, creation date, solo status flag
- Users table: Store user profiles with company relationship and role
- Jobs table: Always include technician assignment field (even for solos)

5. **Solo Mode Optimization**:
- Automatically assign new jobs to the owner
- Hide technician selection dropdowns
- Simplify dashboard to single-user view
- Replace "Dispatch" terminology with "My Schedule"
- Hide team reporting/analytics

6. **Team Mode Preparation**:
- Keep all team functionality in code but hidden for solo users
- Use feature flags to toggle team features
- Maintain role permissions structure
- Keep technician assignment logic active (even if auto-assigned)

7. **Ongoing User Experience**:
- After onboarding, always redirect to dashboard
- Store user preferences in database
- Allow upgrading from solo to team mode later via settings
- For existing users: Bypass onboarding completely

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Timing**:
- Add onboarding now before building other features
- Implement the profile check immediately after login
- Create database tables for companies and profiles first

2. **UI Considerations**:
- Keep onboarding to a single page/screen
- Use your existing design system for consistency
- Make "solo mode" checkbox prominent
- Provide skip option (though not recommended)

3. **Performance**:
- Cache company/user data after onboarding
- Minimize database calls during initial load
- Make transitions between states smooth

4. **Edge Cases**:
- Handle duplicate company names gracefully
- Validate email domains if needed
- Provide "Edit Company Info" in settings later

5. **Security**:
- Ensure company data isolation
- Validate user owns company before operations
- Implement proper session management

This flow gives you the foundation for both solo and team use cases while keeping the initial experience simple for individual contractors. The key is setting up that company/user relationship immediately after first login.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this flow or describe how the dashboard should adapt between solo and team modes?
